the cat is furry
he arrived too early
my shoes are wet
the pear is rotten
show me the car
the book was new
get out of there
I work on Tuesday
please close the door
go to a movie
your dog looks happy
she ate every cookie
your shirt is bright
the floor is very dirty
I can swim very fast
soccer is a fun sport
you have lots of energy
can we go home now
the red bike was lost
I see my new friend
the dog slept all day
the giraffe is really tall
it was raining all day
where is the red one
look at the tall tree
he wants to go soon
you have really long hair
the clouds are very dark
the brain is so incredible
put the shoes down there
let's go on a hike
it really is very beautiful
focus on doing your best
where did he go yesterday
she went to the park
that guy makes me laugh
sometimes I need to rest
she wants to go shopping
it is just basic science
look at the beautiful sunset
you are really working your brain
why follow when you can lead
don't forget to take a break
what you focus on you manifest
what did you do on Friday
she wants to become a doctor
find the one with black spots
I like to cook delicious meals
he needs to get a haircut
consistency is the key to succes
I need to go to school
run fast in your big race
that girl has long curly hair
attention is the foundation of cognition
we are living in a yellow submarine
there is no moment like this one
you are doing great work
always look on the bright side of life
can you make sense of a long sentence?
there is nothing to be afraid of
get up, get on up
once upon a time in a land far far away
care for magical creatures
you're a wizard, harry!
when you know, you know
you have nice shoes
these are waves, not mountains
don't worry, be happy
