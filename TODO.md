# Perhabs roadmap
In a very loose sense of the word.

## DONE
- Random timer on loop ('hot potato')
- Anaglyph drawing

## IN PROGRESS
- Porting Vizier to Perhabs
    - Rework anaglyph algo to split manipulation of arrays and drawing pixels (in the interest of wasting less cpu cycles)

## TODO
- Delay on speaking new sentence (get back to task first)
- TTS on number gen
- Tweak number gen: more refined algo to prevent uninteresting tasks
- Breathing app that can run parallel to other stuff
- Exercise planning
- Exercise recording
- Exercise stats
- Cog numbers: game mode where you enter back the numbers and it gets prog more difficult
- Scattegories game
- Visual error handling
- Breaking down words game
