# Perhabs
A package of cognitive (incl visual, auditory) exercises to support brain injury rehabilitation. Takes inspiration from Cognitive FX and other mTBI-therapies.

Perhabs is especially useful for people wanting to exercise their brains by themselves. Some exercises rely on having someone read you the next cue. Perhabs can do that for you!

The exercises in this package are provided as-is. Use them as fits your recovery process. Consult your therapist/physician to determine the selection and intensity of exercises that will benefit you.
